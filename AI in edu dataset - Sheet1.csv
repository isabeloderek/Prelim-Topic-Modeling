AI tool sare very helpful but you need to use it properly and NO they are not going to replace humans. Because you still need the human touch!,tiktok,Positive
AI and teachers should join forces in a collaborative effort to revolutionize education. AI and teachers can empower students with the best of both.,tiktok,Positive
Kids that learn how to use the AI will realize what careers will be obsolete because of AI and take a smarter path,tiktok,Negative
"But here’s the thing, if we embrace the AI, how will students ever learn to form their own opinions if they can ask an AI to form it for them",tiktok,Negative
"AI is helpful but still requires human intervention. Not all information fed by AI are correct, still need human correctness...",tiktok,Neutral
I'm 50/50 on this. kids need to know the basics and how to work for something otherwise they won't use it as a tool,tiktok,Neutral
ChatGPT can be an educational provider offers unique advantages over traditional classrooms. Students can learn at their own pace what interest them.,tiktok,Positive
Get an idea on AI but also read and understand your required readings and write your own thoughts about it. I use AI to strengthen my arguments,tiktok,Positive
"It’s real bad already. It’s going to get worse.

As an English teacher, I imagine I’ll have lots of exams where they write the papers in front of me… which is terribly unfair but what else is there?

It’s going to be rough.",reddit,Negative
To an extent it is okay. It’s like the calculator was. You still should understand what is happening to make sure everything is functioning properly,tiktok,Positive
m all on board with this depending on the assignment. the school system needs reform for the technologies we have today,tiktok,Neutral
The school system has been outdated for years and chatgpt is just the most recent proof of that problem,tiktok,Positive
using chatgpt or any ai writing tools like Undetectable AI is not really cheating.. it depends on how you use them.,tiktok,Positive
So basically kids are getting someone else (AI) to do their homework & we don’t think this is a dumbing down of a generation?,tiktok,Negative
"well chatgpt is killing our creativity we should do it on our own and not think like a ai, create our own ideas",tiktok,Negative
If u can get all the information of ur assignment on ai faster that u can do it then what it the point of actually learning that information,tiktok,Negative
so where's the sense in attending to school if AI would do that for them?,tiktok,Negative
"Use ChatGPT and learn nothing, how will we ever advance as a society",tiktok,Negative
"Students need to be able to express their own thoughts and knowledge though, not use a robot to think and say it for them",tiktok,Negative

He’s saying that the education system needs to change its structure so that AI can be beneficially implemented. It’s not meant to replace thinking.,tiktok,Positive
"We need to LEARN instead of cheating or using AI then copy paste it,AI can help us understand the topic but we also need to have our own answer so we can see if we really learn the subject or topic",tiktok,Negative
"Although AI can be helpful in certain situations, and yes it is a tool. I do believe that it will diminish people’s ability to learn properly.",tiktok,Negative
Ai is not the problem here. The problem is the students or the user that is not responsible of using ai tools such as chat gpt.,tiktok,Positive
"AI in teaching and learning will become the norm in the coming years. Even if teachers avoid implementing AI in education, students, due to their wide exposure, can use it for their learning purposes. Therefore, teachers must exercise caution when implementing AI in the learning process to prevent its improper use.",quora,Positive
"AI can reduce teachers' workloads and be used for regular activities. Teachers can focus on polishing their teaching styles and making their teaching more effective. Students can use AI for their growth. In the coming future, AI can act as their tutor and teach them anywhere, anytime, with plenty of resources that AI has access to.",quora,Positive
"AI can revolutionize education by providing personalized learning experiences tailored to students' individual needs and learning styles. With AI, educators can analyze large amounts of data on student performance, behavior, and preferences to develop individualized learning plans for each student. This can help students learn independently, with content and assessments designed to meet their unique needs.",quora,Positive
"I believe that AI education is essential for everyone. AI is rapidly transforming many industries and aspects of our lives, and it is important for people to have a basic understanding of AI in order to thrive in the 21st century.",quora,Positive
"My opinion on AI used in schools is that it has great potential to improve education quality and outcomes, but it also requires careful consideration and regulation to ensure that it is aligned with the human rights and values of education.",quora,Positive
"I believe the potential of artificial intelligence in public education is vast and promising. AI technologies can personalize learning experiences, provide valuable insights for educators, and streamline administrative tasks. However, it's crucial to ensure that AI implementation in education is ethical, transparent, and equitable. We must address concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and access to technology to truly harness the benefits of AI while minimizing its risks.",quora,Positive
"Yes, it’s critical for k-12 education. Adaptive learning allows students to learn at their own pace and be tested at their levels, regardless of their access to quality teachers. The AI and software that underlies learning platforms in general allows education to scale without the need for teachers or classrooms. This was critical during COVID and one of the reasons poor children across the world ended up behind—lack of access to this technology relative to wealthy areas.",quora,Positive
We’re now at the stage where students are using AI to do their homework. Eventually there won’t be any jobs. Governments won’t want to fund schools. Students will see no reason for attending.,quora,Negative
"AI is helpful for teachers too. I use it to complete SPED paperwork all the time. While not exactly the same, I think of AI like a calculator. I plug in what I need solved, and I get a response.",Youtube,Positive
"Learning will now be accessible for the forgotten, misplaced, and abandoned. As a PhD Student in Machine learning/Data Science. Who was once a Special Ed student. I'm so excited for all current and future students.",Youtube,Positive
"As a high school teacher, the use of AI in the classroom cannot be avoided or banned. Instead, teachers must learn how to use AI to enhance student learning. Teachers should be showing students how to appropriately use AI in their class, rather than saying its simply ""cheating"" or not allowed.",Youtube,Neutral
"It’s a tool. In order to utilize it efficiently and effectively one must first understand the basic concept of the outcome in order to evaluate it. So, yes. Students must know how to think critically and write well. Now, here is the real question. Will students learn more from AI than from the average English teacher who doesn’t even have an English degree?",Youtube,Neutral
"We are already too reliant on technology. In a face-to-face interview, your student may not be able to think on his or her feet. If the company or government security does not allow electronics to enter its offices from outside, your student will have his first real test.",Youtube,Negative
"In large classes, students often don’t receive the individual attention they need. A one-size-fits-all approach only works for some, leading to boredom and low motivation. Teachers also face many challenges, including heavy administrative workloads, outdated materials, and difficulties in maintaining students’ attention. Should we continue down this path?
With AI in your toolkit, you can tackle these problems. AI education can personalize learning, adjusting to each student’s pace and style and providing them with the support they need. AI can also take over routine administrative tasks, giving teachers more time to focus on teaching. Plus, AI tools can offer up-to-date resources and help ensure that students in remote areas have access to quality education.",quora,Positive
AI can be used to enchance learning but most of the students do it in an opposite way,Youtube,Neutral
"My concern is to what degree we will become codependent on AI. At the moment, it is about writing emails, papers, etc. How little will we have to learn in the future because AI will do it for us. No more spelling. No more writing. No more basic math.",Youtube,Negative
"I'm a university professor (Jesuit university in the Midwest) and can report that a significant proportion of my students use ChatGPT or some other AI program to write their papers for them. It's to the point where many of us have now concluded that giving written work outside of class is meaningless. There's detection software that flags AI-generated content, but it's not entirely accurate (gives false positives and negatives), and students find ways around it. So, while I agree that there's much potential for AI in education, my experience has made me far less sanguine about it than Mr. Khan.",Youtube,Negative
"The reason why I was an advocate about AI is not because I can get better grades with less effort but to let the educators show that the education paradigm needs to change. From ""we should have knowledge"" to ""how should we utilize information"", instead of battling with AI, use them as a tool.",Youtube,Positive
"I have been teaching in various countries on various levels (college, high school) for 33 years now, so I guess I'm considered a veteran teacher. And yes, I have been using AI! I love it. It does make lesson planning easier, and it saves a lot of time for me.",facebook,Positive
"It will ruin education if we refuse to learn it, use it and teach the kids to use it.",facebook,Negative
"This makes me so sad. How do we learn if we don’t wrestle with ideas? How do we learn if we don’t have to organize our thoughts and eloquently present our ideas? So what if a computer can do it faster? What are we doing to our kids? What are the ramifications of their future if they don’t have to put in the work themselves? We are dumbing down future generations, making them servants and slaves because we aren’t training their brains. Technology is a beautiful thing, but there are consequences and I shudder at the thought of what we are doing to future generations.",facebook,Negative
"Students using AI, will never know what they can do. They will never learn about themselves. Reading, writing, analyzing, thinking, and problem solving develop neural connections and neurotransmitters. AI cheats students out of brain development.",X,Negative
Idk i think this assumes that people will make “good” decisions with the tech. AI is clearly harming education at all levels and also seems to be taking over in large part because it’s ruining it,X,Negative
I guess this is a boomer take but education is a privilege and it should be treated as such. The invention of AI is ruining the beauty of learning and it makes me really sad.,X,Negative
"As a teacher, AI definitely is ruining learning, but education in itself is no longer a privilege. You need it to function in any type of way in society and if you want any quality of life. I just wish they would stop allowing computer learning in school and go back to paper :/",X,Negative
ChatGPT and other AI tools over time will reduce people's ability to think critically. We're already seeing it with people who blindly copy/paste what's given to them and just assuming it's correct (even when ChatGPT literally makes things up),X,Negative
20 Top UK universities just made a similar announcement. Pro-active countries like Japan and the UK who are embracing AI will probably become world leaders in this space. The tech is here to stay so let's make it work for us.,X,Positive
"I agree with using AI. Education will be a lot easier and convenient. It can benefit teachers and students simultaneously. As a college-student, I find tools like ChatGPT and Bing AI Copilot really helpful. We really need to adapt to this kind of times. Kudos, Japan!",X,Positive
"AI's helping IT overcome skill gaps! Language models write complex scripts, boosting efficiency. As a local school district CTO, I see this as a win for education. - Tam N, Orange Unified School District",X,Positive
"neat tool, not too bad for introducing general concepts, it seems. could be a useful study tool. still not seeing how any AI tool could successfully demonstrate the skills needed to make teaching effective. they always seem to be dynamic, generative self-study programs as opposed to instruction.",reddit,Positive
"AI in education can personalize learning, automate tasks, and provide constant support.",reddit,Positive
"I think it’s great for helping with mundane work, like simplifying assignments, writing quizzes, etc. but you still have to proofread and make edits.

Where it’s not helpful is kids using it to complete assignments for them without demonstrating to me that they actually know content or skills.",reddit,Positive
"Generative AI was made to aid humans, hence its ability to perform humanlike tasks. A way these AIs can assist students is by giving inspiration for assignments regarding writing and art. The “help” provided by generative AI can negatively affect schools and how people learn because of the false information, chatbots specifically, are known to give out.

An example of this is when I used the chatbot Poe to give five quotes from The Diary of Anne Frank, and none of the quotes given were in the publication at all. The spreading of misinformation done by these generative AIs just goes to show how unreliable they may be. Despite the help they may bring to humans, their downsides prove them to be untrustworthy.",Education Week,Negative
"I think that the impact that generative AI might have on school is that it can narrow down the learning and perspectives that the students might have. For example, when we used most AI generators for images, we saw that it was very biased and only showed a certain group of people when talking about certain topics. According to magazine Insider, “The study found 97% of DALL-E 2’s images of positions of authority—like “CEO” or “director” —depicted white men.” If we keep on teaching kids these narrow-minded ideas and images, we will never see some try and show people that they can do a lot more and make a greater impact to the Earth without having to be a certain race or ethnicity.",Education Week,Negative
"Generative AI has both a positive and negative impact on schools and the way people learn. Tools such as these can benefit people in working more efficiently and also checking one’s work. Although these AIs help people work more efficiently, the work is not always held to a high standard nor is it always correct. Many times tools like these make up work that is not even real.

They do not function as humans. These tools “learn patterns from their training data and use that to create plausible responses to prompts.” They don’t actually have information that is credible or reliable. This can cause problems and affect how both schools function and how people learn. While AIs can help improve one’s work, they should not be used to produce a person’s work. AIs don’t have the mind or capacity a human brain has.

Students also must not rely on AIs to do their work because then they won’t feel the need to pay attention in class and learn because they know that an AI can do the work for them. AIs are not bad at all, it’s just that people might use them for the wrong things like to get work done instead of doing your work and then using an AI to check that work. AI is neither good nor bad, it all just depends on how a person uses the AI.",Education Week,Neutral
"Artificial intelligence has a negative impact on students and the ways they learn. Throughout the various videos and toying-around-with-AI, I’ve come to the conclusion that artificial intelligence may impede on the value of learning/creating and just factually distribute wrong information.

Addressing my first claim, I think that artificial intelligence takes away the meaning from the learning process within the classroom; normally you’re told to communicate, to better your work, and to get help. If we use AI to do things such as suggesting changes or judging a person’s writing/work to better fit the AI’s idea of what “good” is, then we lose the complete meaning and discovery of various subjects.",Education Week,Negative
"The impact I believe generative AI might have on schools and the way people learn is creating a new era of knowledge revolving around inspiration. Generative AI is able to provide all sorts of ideas and automated answers to questions which can take the load off for students. However, not all automated answers are correct; this will call for the student to double-check sources and scrap the AI’s response into their own.

As stated in the article, “Generative AI”, AI has been used to “create overviews on topics, essays, and artwork” which allows the student to take inspiration from suggestions instead of plagiarizing. This means that the conversation surrounding plagiarism will become more common in institutions of education, but the ability to receive aid will also improve.",Education Week,Positive
"In navigating this landscape, it's crucial to approach AI as a tool that enhances, rather than replaces, the role of educators. Striking a balance between technological innovation and the preservation of the intrinsic value of education is key. The ongoing debate reflects the need for a thoughtful and inclusive discussion on shaping the future of AI in education, considering its potential benefits and pitfalls. Ultimately, the responsible integration of AI in education requires a nuanced understanding of its impact on students, teachers, and the broader educational ecosystem. As Dana highlighted her view and question as well. In fact, the impact of AI on learning is a topic that hinges on how it's utilized. While there are concerns about AI enabling cheating by providing quick answers, it also holds the potential to enhance the learning experience. AI tools, when designed ethically, can serve as valuable aids, offering personalized support, fostering critical thinking, and providing resources for deeper understanding. The key lies in striking a balance by leveraging AI to supplement education while ensuring it doesn't compromise the integrity of the learning process. Responsible integration and thoughtful use of AI can empower learners rather than encourage shortcuts.",Youtube,Neutral

"I think the future of education is AI. However, the education system is extremely linear, and reforming education for our kids will be a big challenge to overcome in the next decade.",Instagram,Positive
"I totally disagree!!! Your thinking is totally one dimensional .Where is the most essential component of human development if AI is teaching our kids in the future. Human interaction with emotions are essential for moral thinking. The basis of our morality shapes who we become in our learning process and that requires both parties to possess this God given gift. It puts us on an equal level of development, otherwise AI will always be superior to humans.",Instagram,Negative
"Certainly, education often follows a linear path, but as a technology teacher in an elementary school, I emphasize the need to move beyond fundamental skills and cultivate creativity and innovation in students. When students enter the technology classroom, I want them to see it as a place full of possibilities, where they can explore and decide what they want to experiment with each day.",Instagram,Positive

I’d love to know great tools to use as a librarian and teacher of research skills.",Instagram,Positive
I love this and totally agree! We shouldn't be banning it but rather adopting it as a part of life! I talk to my kids and the kids on the programme about how to do this effectively. It's going to one the most important life skills yet!!,Instagram,Positive
It will not build critical thinking. It’s cheating,Instagram,Negative
100 percent agree. Besides the fact that the current education system is already outdated and outmoded . I mean it literally made to make a profit and keep people in debt. We need a modern gameified education system that allows collaboration and iteration. Something that challenges us to become more than we have ever been before. Something that improves our lives and standard of living whilst also spreading truth and equality. Not something that pits us against each other so a few large corporations can skim the profits from the work of the masses,Instagram,Positive
"I could not disagree more. If AI was allowed on universities, none of the students would have to do none of the Homeworks AI can literally do everything for them. And they would learn NOTHING. Not to mention the thousands of intrusion of privacy, legal issues and moral issues. Governments are literally using AI to ban people from entering countries. Authorities are using it as well. Not just criminals. Everyone and everything is at grave risk. The greatest minds in the world just wtned the world about it telling companies to stop using it to slow down. That’s progress, because the world far from catching up with. Who are you to see any? Otherwise, some dude on Instagram give me a fucking break.",Instagram,Negative
we are kidding ourselves...ai will be the writer from now on but we will remain the reader and the editor forever,tiktok,Positive
Cheating is the obvious pop up question regarding AI; the solution is to ask different questions. Oral presentations should become the gold standard instead of essay exams. It’s either that or project based grades where what is used to complete a project is not limited. Why do we want to limit our youth?

Second, it is truly hard to see the benefits of something if you don’t know how to truly use it and then how to apply it to others…… as a system we say we are a research based institution but quite often I only see the research getting applied to the classroom that benefits the system and the teacher.

And sometimes they even copied the URL or the name of the site and forgot to remove it from handouts. A typical student will just study the handouts, try to answer the problems that's it. But me and my buddies were different. We got everything we could get from the said site and used it as our advantage to the point we even got exempted from our final exam. Some of you will say it's cheating but for me and my buddies at that time, we are just being resourceful.  My point is regarding this AI stuff that if there's something you could use to your advantage why not make the best of it. \n\nFollowing the rules is good. It's what separates us from wild animals.
